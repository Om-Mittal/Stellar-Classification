# Stellar-Classification

This repository contains the code for classification of stellar objects into 3 categories - Stars, Galaxies and Quasars, using provided features. A snapshot ensembled ANN and an ensemble of several boosting and bagging classifiers have been employed; the weights of these classifiers were established by examining their individual confusion matrices, F-1 scores, and accuracies.
